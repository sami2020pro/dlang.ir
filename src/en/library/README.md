# Library

[Phobos](https://dlang.org/phobos/index.html) Runtime Library
Phobos is the standard runtime library that comes with the D language compiler.

Generally, the std namespace is used for the main modules in the Phobos standard library. The etc namespace is used for external C/C++ library bindings. The core namespace is used for low-level D runtime functions.

The following table is a quick reference guide for which Phobos modules to use for a given category of functionality. Note that some modules may appear in more than one category, as some Phobos modules are quite generic and can be applied in a variety of situations.
